## Introduction

Welcome to the **PCA Lab**! In this lab, you will explore **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, a widely used technique for **dimensionality reduction**. PCA is useful for **simplifying datasets**, improving computational efficiency, and identifying patterns in high-dimensional data.

You will apply **PCA** to a **customer retail dataset**, learning how to standardize features, reduce dimensionality, and interpret the **explained variance ratio**.

Letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€

## Important Notes

- **Standardizing the dataset** before applying PCA is essential to ensure all features contribute equally.
- PCA **does not preserve interpretability** of original features but helps in **visualizing data structure**.
- The number of components selected affects how much variance in the dataset is retained.
